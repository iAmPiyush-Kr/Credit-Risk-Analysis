# Credit-Risk-Analysis
--Edited

### Analysis and predictive modeling of Credit Risk. It is important that when a borrower applies for a loan, the lender or the issuer must establish and examine the borrowerâ€™s ability to repay the loan.

# Dataset:

### Gathered a dataset simulating credit bureau data to deny or approve someone credit


# Overall Steps:
1. Exploring the Dataset(EDA)
2. Applying Oversampling Techniques
3. Test various machine learning models using Cross Validation technique
4. Hyperparameter tune the best model
5. Analyse the best model with the help of relevant Metrics
6. Pickling the best model
7. A sample prediction will be made to test the application

# Algorithms Used:
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

# Fine Tuning:
- Column Transformation
- Over Sampling
- Model with different Hyperparameters

# Accuracy Metrics:
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision Recall Curve
- AUC-ROC Curve
